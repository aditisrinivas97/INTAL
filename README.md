# INTAL
C Library of functions to compute addition, subtraction, multiplication, division and exponentiation (positive exponent) of integers of arbitrary length.

Addition and Subtraction are done using brute force.
Multiplication is done using the Karatsuba algorithm for fast multiplication.
Division is done using a modified brute force algorithm (Number of subtractions reduced by adding multiplications by 10).
Exponentiation is done by repeated multiplication.
